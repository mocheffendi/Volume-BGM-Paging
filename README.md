# Volume-BGM-Paging

Automation for BGM &amp; Paging

This is build with ESP 8266 to automate between BGM and Paging in my Office 
With concept :
1. If 06.00 AM then Background Music is starting (Volume 100%).
2. If 11.00 PM then Background Music is ending (Volume 0%).
3. If there is paging then Volume BGM is down to 0%.
4. If no paging then in 5sec Volume BGM is up to 100%
